|Name   | Explanation   |   |  Example |   |
|--- |--- |--- |--- |--- |
| string  | This is a sequence of text known as a string. To signify that the value is a string, enclose it in single quote marks.  |      | ```let stringVariable = 'Bob'```  |
|Number    |  This is a number. Numbers don't have quotes around them.  let myVariable = 10;  |     |  ```let variableNumber = 100;``` |
|Boolean   | This is a True/False value. The words true and false are special keywords that don't need quote marks  |     |  ```let variableBoolean = true;```  |
|Array  | This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference. |   |     ```let myVariable = [1,'Bob','Steve',10];``` ```//access values in array in this syntax``` ```console.log(myVariable[0], myVariable[1]);``` |
|Object   |  This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable. Keep this in mind as you learn.  | | ```let myVariable = document.querySelector('h1');```
